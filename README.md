### A simple counter application with ReactJS and CirrusUI.

* Buttons have a hover effect. 
* While we do not want the counter value to go below 0, it is limited to 0 so that it does not move in a negative direction. 
* At the same time, if the value is 0, the reset and decrease buttons are turned off.
